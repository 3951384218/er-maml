# ER-MAML: Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Gradient Regularization
**ER-MAML** is an improved version of the **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)** algorithm, designed to enhance **generalization** in meta-reinforcement learning tasks. This repository provides the core implementation of ER-MAML, hyperparameter configurations, and auxiliary code based on the original MAML framework.
